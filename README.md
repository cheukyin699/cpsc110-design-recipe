This little thingy was made because the edX platform was too slow in loading up
the reference pages. This should be an issue only to a select few, since I found
that loading it up without one specific plugin (Dark Reader) would make it load
4 times faster.

Since I do mind getting my eyes blasted with bright white light every time I
check out the reference page, I'd rather make this separate site (copy of) to
view the HtD recipes instead of enduring the default light theme that edX seems
to be so fond of.

Anyways, this site loads up really fast since I stripped it of everything (it
was originally 20000+ lines of HTML, with styles, js, and scripts and whatnot);
even faster than edX itself. Just goes to show what a simple HTML page without
any styles (added 1 style to make it easier to read) goes for performance,
especially on Github's static site hosting.
